## What is All About Paws Scheduling App?

The All About Paws Scheduling app is a schedule planning and managing application, that was developed for All About Paws Pet Spa LLC. Once the user has made an appointment with a Store owner/System admin, the admin will be able to create and manage the appointment online.

When a user schedules an appointment via phone or in person, the admin will be in charge of inputting the information into the scheduler app and an appointment will be created. The appointment details will then be available online for the user to see.
