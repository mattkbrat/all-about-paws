# All About Paws - Scheduling Appointments Application

## Getting started with application
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Check the package.json file to see what other scripts are available and the dependencies.
To install the depdencies, run the following command:
```npm install```. 
Some devices will fail to install the dependencies with the default command. In these cases, install with ```npm install --legacy-peer-deps```.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can start the application by running the following command:
```npm start``` from the /front directory.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Getting started with database
This app depends on supabase for authentication and database (PostgreSQL).
To obtain the .env file, contact the project owner. Place the .env file in ./front
